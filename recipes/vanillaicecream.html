  <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 1/2 cups heavy cream</li>
      <li>1 1/2 cups whole milk</li>
      <li>2/3 cup cane sugar</li>
      <li>2 tsps vanilla extract </li>
      <li>1/8 tsp sea salt</li>
    </ul>

  <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>In a medium saucepan, combine the cream, milk, sugar, vanilla, and salt. Warm over medium-low heat, whisking often, for 5 minutes, or until the sugar dissolves and the mixture is warmed through.
      </li>
      <li>Remove the chilled ice cream base from the fridge and whisk well. Churn in an ice cream maker according to the manufacturerâ€™s instructions, typically 20 to 30 minutes. The ice cream will be soft after churning. For firmer ice cream, transfer to an airtight container and freeze for 2 to 4 hours before serving.</li>
      <li>Store in an airtight container in the freezer for up to a month. If the ice cream is too firm to scoop straight from the freezer, let sit at room temperature for a few minutes to soften.</li>
      <li>Serve with desired toppings</li>
